If it is not possible to rebook online because of the payment method, then you will be informed accordingly during the rebooking process).

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Yes, you are allowed to update your flight to something sooner, as long as your ticket meets specific conditions. Here are the key points regarding changing your flight:

1. **Active Booking**: Your ticket must have an active flight booking.
2. **Rebooking Time**: You can rebook your flight online up to three hours before your scheduled departure if you are departing from a Swiss airport.
3. **Fare Conditions**: Depending on your fare conditions, there may be fees associated with the change.
4. **Single Flight Routes**: You can change outbound (one-way) tickets or return tickets with single flight routes (point-to-point).
5. **Seat and Meal Reservations**: Your existing seat and any special meal requests will be retained in the new booking.

Since your current flight is scheduled to depart in just a few minutes, you should act quickly if you wish to change it. Would you like me to assist you in finding an earlier flight?
